# EU Crop Map 2018 - Random Point Sampling

This code uses open source data (GAEZ, EU Crop Map, NUTS2 boundaries), to calculate the difference between conventional and organic yields (using an example conversion rate - this is **not** the real conversion rate) at 200 random cropland raster cells in a specified NUTS2 region.

The results at the end allow the user to specify the proportin of land that you are converting from conventional to organic.
